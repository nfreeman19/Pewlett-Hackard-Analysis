# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Module 7

### Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We then wrote a report that summarizes your analysis and helped prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Results:

* There is a large number or employees that could retire soon. (Image below)
* Most of the positions retiring are senior level, which makes sense.
* There would need to be mentorship training soon to fill these higher level postions.
* The engineering career will be the most needed based on the numbers anbd titles.

### Summary:

There will be a lot of employees being able to retire at anytime now. The mentorship program needs to be in place for them to be prepared. There are enough employees but to be cautious they need to nake sure the employees who are not retiring have the aright amount of training and understadning to take on the retirees roles.
