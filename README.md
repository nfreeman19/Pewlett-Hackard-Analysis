# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Module 7

### Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We then wrote a report that summarizes your analysis and helped prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Results:

* Most of the positions retiring are senior level, which makes sense.
* There would need to be traing soon to fill these higher level postions.
* The engineering career will be the most needed based on the numbers anbd titles.
